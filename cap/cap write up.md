# Cap

Hi:) this is my first write up and I decided to chose easy machine **Cap** from HTB.

## Enumeration

Just starting with Nmap:

```
nmap -sVC 10.10.10.245
```

![nmap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/428de170-61a9-4b2b-be77-85d76d020844)

Here we can see 3 tcp ports and on one of them there is FTP, in the future it may be useful. But now letâ€™s check the website. Add this to hosts file (or the site will not work):

```
10.10.10.245 cap.htb
```

## Checking HTTP (port 80)

Wow, it's logged as user. Here we can see different pages: _**IP config**_ shows output of the `ifconfig` command, _**Network status**_ the output of the `netstat`, but the "Security snapshot" caught my attention.

When downloading, we get a **6.pcap** file, by opening it with **wireshark**, we can see the network data. If we try to re-visit this page, we will see a different value in the address bar, I have this value `7`. And if we try to change this value ourselves, there will be another file. Well, this is [IDOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecure_direct_object_reference).

Deciding to check each **pcap** file, I tried the value `0`, and yes! This one is different from the others.

After analyzing it a little, I saw these lines:

Here we see requests in which the user _**Nathan**_ logs in and is successful, which means we can use this data.

### What we have at the moment? 
- Login: Nathan
- Password: Buck3tH4TF0RM3!


We've found out the most important thing, so now we can move on to logging in and searching for the flag.
